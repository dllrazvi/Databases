# Databases â€“ Course Summary
This repository gathers all my practical projects and assignments for the Databases course, covering core database principles, SQL data modeling, advanced queries, and schema versioning concepts.
## Course Structure and Topics Covered
### 1. Relational Database Design
- Designing entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) for structured systems

- Building normalized relational schemas with primary, foreign keys, and constraints

- Creating clean data models for both simple (dentist management) and complex systems (blockchain simulation)

### 2. SQL Programming
- DDL (Data Definition Language): create, alter, drop tables

- DML (Data Manipulation Language): insert, update, delete operations

- Advanced Queries: JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL), nested subqueries, aggregate functions

- Use of views, stored procedures, and functions for logic abstraction

### 3. Advanced Topics Practiced
- Blockchain-inspired database schema: accounts, blocks, miners, transactions, smart contracts

- Complex procedures for:

-- Version control (with rollback/forwarding of database schema)

-- Constraint manipulation (adding/dropping keys dynamically)

-- Automated schema migrations using custom procedures

- Indexing strategies and execution plan analysis on random data

- Data manipulation with cascading foreign keys

## Skills and Knowledge Gained
- Mastery in designing normalized databases with real-world use cases

- Proficiency in SQL Server T-SQL syntax

- Experience with schema versioning systems, useful in professional environments

- Ability to handle complex data relations (many-to-many, self-references, cascades)

- Understanding of performance optimization via indexing and query analysis

- Exposure to both transactional systems and conceptual blockchain ledger simulation
